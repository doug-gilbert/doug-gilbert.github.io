RD6006, RD6012, RD6018 DC Power Supplies with UniSoft firmware</h1>
<h2 class="western">Introduction</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">This document
describes firmware running in the popular &quot;DC Power Supplies&quot;
models RD6006, RD6012 and RD6018 written by UniSoft. There are
variants sold with a WIFI daughter board that have &quot;W&quot;
append to the model name and they use the same firmware. The power
supplies are made by Hangzhou Ruideng Technology Co. Ltd that
hereafter will be called <b>Ruideng</b> or <b>Riden</b><span style="font-weight: normal">;</span>
the latter is the name that appears on the front of these power
supplies. Electrically they can termed as DC <i>buck</i> converters,
that are designed to take an input voltage in the 65 to 70 Volts DC
range and step it <i>down</i> to a user-selectable voltage in the
0-60 Volts DC range. The last two digits of the product name
indicated the maximum current they can deliver (e.g. the RD6018 can
deliver up to 18 Amps). <b>Ruideng</b> has done a good job of
documenting their power supplies and postscript files can be found at
this <a href="http://www.ruidengkeji.com/inst/">url</a> (note: http
rather than https).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Note that DC power
supplies used in electronics, often called lab power supplies,
typically take <i>mains</i> AC Voltage as input (85 to 250 Volts AC,
50 or 60 Hertz). That is one reason why retailers of the RD60xx
products usually sell a mains AC adapter to 65 to 70 Volts DC and a
box to hold the adapter and the RD60xx. The author's power supply
(PS) is a RD6018 with a 800 Watt AC adapter that outputs around 68
Volts DC under no load.  As most of the screenshots are from the
author's PS small differences may appear between the reader's PS and
other models. For example, only the RD6006 has 1 milliAmp (mA)
current setting resolution while the two &quot;larger&quot; models
have 10 milliAmp current setting resolution. Bigger is not always
better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">On 25 June 2020
<a href="https://www.eevblog.com/">eevblog</a> user &quot;UniSoft&quot;
sent a post to the Test Equipment board in the &quot;RuiDeng Riden
RD6006 DC power supply&quot; thread announcing: &quot;I recovered
firmware source code of RD6006... Here is my <strong>beta</strong>
version, if anyone interested.&quot; Probably before that date he
sent beta versions to a Russian electronics board. His bio on eevblog
gives his nationality as from Kazakhstan, his gender: male and his
location as Shenzhen, China. Other than that we know he writes good
firmware and is very responsive to any bug reports. It seems the
manufacturer, Ruideng, has adopted some of UniSoft's ideas and
incorporated them in their more recent firmware updates. This can
make it a little difficult to identify a feature as a UniSoft
addition is it may appear later in Ruideng firmware. But for users of
these DC power supplies, this seems like a win-win situation. The
source code that generates UniSoft's firmware has not been open
sourced. When asked about this UniSoft said that it contained some
encryption code that the manufacturer would not want to see made
public. That said, UniSoft has stated that he has no relationship
with Ruideng.</p>
<h2 class="western">Status</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">This document was
started in February 2021. The most recent beta firmware at the time
were:  RD6006 (in zip file: RD60061_V1.34.1m.zip), RD6012 (in zip
file: RD60121_V1.33.1m.zip) and RD6018 (in zip file:
RD60181_V1.34.1m.zip) released on 14 February 2021. This firmware
will also work on the “W” variants (e.g. RD6006W) which add a
WIFI daughter board for remote control and monitoring. Note that the
recently released RD6006P (a hybrid switching/linear DC power supply)
has sufficiently different hardware that UniSoft has indicated that
he is not producing firmware for it at this time.</p>
<h2 class="western">Front Panel</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Here is a rendering
of the front panel of a RD6012 from Ruideng's manual, as is the
following legend:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><img src="rd60xx-unisoft_html_389e54db83c93776.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="688" height="409">

<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Legend:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><img src="rd60xx-unisoft_html_1802db5c0e2d9479.png" name="Image3" align="left" width="1073" height="323">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">When referring to a
button on the front panel, &quot;[{letter}]&quot; is used where
{letter} is a letter in the above front panel image. Since [L] covers
four buttons, [^], [v], [&lt;], and [&gt;] are used for more
precision.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">For UniSoft firmware
we might add these extra markings:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">a greyed &quot;OPP&quot;
	above the MEM button [C]</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">a greyed &quot;TIME&quot;
	above the up arrow [^]</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">a greyed &quot;UVP&quot;
	or &quot;ORP&quot; above the down arrow [v]</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">And if we are
putting extra markings on the RD60xx front panel, this one is a good
reminder:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">a greyed &quot;ISOL&quot;
	under the USB Micro B receptacle to indicate it is isolated from
	terminals [G], [H] and [I] (plus isolated from the Mains AC
	protective ground)</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The power button
[A], the four buttons to its right [B], [C], [D], [E] and the ON/OFF
button [J] are translucent so that internal green LEDs can illuminate
them to show that the corresponding function or mode has been
selected. So they are mode indicators which will go out when
de-selected or another mode is chosen. The power button [A] is often
termed as &quot;soft&quot; because it doesn't really turn of the
power coming into the RD60xx. And to illustrate this its green LED
slowly pulsates when its is indicating &quot;power off&quot;. The
ON/OFF button [J] controls whether power is being delivered to the
front panel terminals: [G], [H] and [I]. The box sold as an accessory
has a &quot;real&quot; power switch on it that will cut the AC mains
supply to the AC/DC supply and thus the RD60xx DC power supply.
Beware that there may be enough residual energy in the AC/DC supply
to run the RD60xx for another few seconds. The safest order to
de-power the unit if first press the ON/OFF button [J] so its LED
goes out, then press button [A] so it starts pulsating, then turn off
the AC main supply with the switch at the back of the box (if
present).</p>
<h2 class="western">A little theory</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">A few formulae and
some basic arithmetic is all that is needed to understand a DC power
supply. Happily all electrical units are in &quot;metric&quot; units,
at least as long as the author can remember. The most recent change
was from cycles-per-second to Hertz in 1960.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">	E = P * t	&lt;1&gt;</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
with E (for Energy) in Joules, P (for Power) in Watts and 't' (for
time) in seconds. In practice we tend to use Watt-Hours (3600
Joules), kiloWatt-Hours (3600000 Joules) and MegaWatt-Hours (3.6 *
10^9 Joules) as units of energy. For comparison a horsepower is
around 735 Watts (&quot;around&quot; since countries have different
size horses, so the term <i>horsepower</i> is best left to
journalists).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">	P = V * I	&lt;2&gt;</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
with P in Watts, V in Volts and I in Amps (formal name: Ampere). More
generally when not speaking about specific amounts, we speak about
voltage and amperage or current. Using fluid flow as an analogy,
voltage can be thought about as pressure and amperage as the volume
that comes out of a pipe in a unit of time. Current is actually the
flow of electrons but before that was known, the electrical
convention was that current flows from higher voltage node (aka the
<i>plus</i> terminal) toward the lower voltage node (aka the <i>negative</i>
terminal) while in reality the electrons flow the other way. Note
that in almost all electronics, for simple DC power supplies, the
negative terminal is known as the <i>ground</i>. A power supply
<i>ground</i> <u>may, or may not </u>be connected to the protective
earth pin of AC Mains outlets. The RD60xx <u>does not</u> have its
negative terminal connected to the protective earth pin of the AC
Mains outlet to which it is plugged; it is said to be floating with
respect to the protective earth. What voltages are considered
dangerous? Well that depends on the situation, for a patient in a
hospital with probes in their chest, just about any &quot;stray&quot;
voltage is dangerous. As a rule of thumb, anything higher than 40
Volts (DC or AC) can be considered dangerous. Note that these DC
power supplies are designed to output up to 60 Volts, so keep that in
mind. When experimenting, always re-check wiring before pressing the
ON/OFF button [J]. AC Mains supply (90 to 264 Volts AC, 45-65 Hertz)
should always be considered extremely dangerous.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">	V = I * R	&lt;3&gt; Ohm's law
	P = I^2 * R	&lt;derived from &lt;2&gt; and &lt;3&gt; (substituting V)&gt;</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
And finally we get to Ohm's law (formula &lt;3&gt;), where R is the
resistance in Ohms. All practical electronic components including
wire have resistance  (greater than 0).  Resistance in wires doubles
when  the wire length is doubled, and halves when the cross-sectional
area of the conductor is doubled. As is often the case, Wikipedia
have a good information about this topic, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge">AWG</a>
. And it is current in conductors that makes them hot (or even fuse)
and the last formula above often is used to refer to this waste (e.g.
&quot;I-squared R losses&quot;). It is not <i>waste</i>, if the
purpose of driving the current through the resistance is to generate
heat. This is why when USB-C Power Delivery (PD) wants to provide 100
Watts it chooses 20 Volts ((near) its maximum voltage) at 5 Amps and
not say 5 Volts at 20 Amps. Also note that even high quality banana
plugs are not rated above 15 Amps, so spade or ring connectors should
be used on the RD6018 for currents in excess of 15 Amps.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">In digital
electronics the simplest things to measure are voltage (often using a
ADC (analog to digital converter)) and time (including frequency).
Current is usually indirectly measured using Ohm's law &lt;3&gt; with
a low-valued resistor in series with the positive rail (near terminal
[I]) or the negative rail (near terminal [G]). The low valued
resistor used for this purpose is often called a <i>shunt</i>
resistor. Power is calculated using formula &lt;2&gt;. And the Energy
usage is often shown in the bottom right of the screen is calculated
using formula &lt;1&gt;.</p>

above is an illustration of OCP (over current protection) being
triggered. Setting OCP lower than I-SET is typically not a good idea;
it was done in this case to deliberately trigger OCP. Once OCP is
triggered, the ON/OFF button is taken to off state which is reflected
by the main Voltage, Amperage and Power all showing zero. The OCP
setting of 4.00 Amps is also changed from turquoise to red and a red
background white OCP replaces the blue background, white tick in the
middle bottom of the screen.</p>

</p>
<h2 class="western">Graph Mode</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Graph mode is
entered by pressing [&lt;] once, or [&gt;] three times (it is a four
way rotation). After running for a short while, graph mode might look
like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><img src="rd60xx-unisoft_html_e46fbd3ad966e6af.png" name="Image10" align="left" width="336" height="256">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The action of the
graph is similar to roll mode in an oscilloscope. The new values are
placed at the right margin (axis) and push the older values to the
left. V-SET and I-SET values are shown in the top left in yellow,
under the heading &quot;SET&quot;. Under the &quot;OUTPUT&quot;
heading are the values measured at the output of the PS. The value in
green on the right is the current voltage. Under that, in turquoise,
is the current amperage (the load in this case is a 10 Ohm, 20 Watt
resistor). Under that in pink is the current power being output,
which is the product of the previous two values. Those colours
correspond to the units of the lines on the graph. The white/grey
line (the topmost line on the graph) is the <i>ex</i><i>ternal
</i>temperature of the PS. The external temperature is from the
sensor plugged into the &quot;External temperature sensor interface&quot;
and is shown periodically in the bottom right of the screen. The
icons and values shown at the bottom of the above image are the same
as they are in other modes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The line directly
<i>below</i> the graph contains the y-axis <i>per</i><i>-</i><i>interval
</i> amounts. So for voltage (green) it is 1.00 Volts per division
and the green line is constant, at 3 intervals up, so close to 3.00
volts (actually we can see it is 2.995 Volts).  The pause symbol
(two, parallel white bars with a blue background) indicates the graph
is paused. When running the graph state is shown as a white arrowhead
with a read background at the same location. The pause/run state can
be toggled by pressing ENTER is graph mode (sometimes it needs to be
pressed twice). The &quot;D:&quot; on the left hand side of that line
stands for &quot;division&quot; (we think). When it has a normal
background</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The rate at which
the graph moves is controlled by the &quot;Graph Window&quot; setting
found within the SHIFT-[v] menu. The setting is for hours and
minutes. The fastest setting permitted is 1 minute and that implies
that a set of values written at the right margin will take 1 minute
to be <i>pushed</i> to the left margin. If the . then values will
take 1 hour to move from the right margin to the left margin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The above image
shows a graph of the PS driving a DC load in CR (constant resistance)
mode. The resistance is lowered in stages until the I-SET value is
reached after which the PS goes into CC mode.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><img src="rd60xx-unisoft_html_8411bb3156974012.png" name="Image12" align="left" width="336" height="256">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The above image
shows a graph (over 1 hour) of trickle charging a 12 Volt car lead
acid battery. The external temperature sensor was placed under the
PS. The battery group setting &quot;cutoff time&quot; was set to 1
hour at which point the charging ceased and 6.64 Watt-hours of energy
had been transferred. The battery symbol on the bottom line shows
that it was in battery mode (and the green terminal on the PS was
connected to the + lug on the battery) plus the white TIME with a red
background is the reason why the charging stopped. N.B. the &quot;Cutoff
current&quot; setting in the battery group is a <i>lower</i> bound so
0 mA is a good starting point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">xxxx</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><img src="rd60xx-unisoft_html_3d4409cfb8c1cee0.png" name="Image14" align="left" width="336" height="256">

</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The above image was
taken while the battery charging was ongoing. That can be seen with
the red battery icon with the yellow background.  Initially I-SET was
1 Amp but was increased to 1.5 Amp (as that was stated current of a
dedicated 6/12 Volt trickle charger device on hand). At that point
the PS went into CC mode; a short time later the battery voltage
reached V-SET and the PS switched to CV mode where it stayed until
the screen shot was taken. Notice the current was slowly dropping
from the point the PS switched from CC to CV mode (as is the Power).
The &quot;play&quot; button (red background, white arrowhead pointing
right) indicates graphing mode was ongoing when the screenshot was
taken. The  Graph Window setting was still 1 hour.</p>

<h2 class="western">ORP</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">This abbreviation
stands for &quot;Over Resistance Protection&quot;, a term not often
used. Inrush Current Limiting (ICL) is related but ORP trips out this
PS while ICL (on other power supplies) places an upper limit on the
current it will source. An example of an ORP <i>trip</i> is shown
below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><img src="rd60xx-unisoft_html_4994a4cd25a696c7.png" name="Image15" align="left" width="336" height="256">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The protection trip
is indicated ORP in white with a red background in the middle of the
bottom of the image (plus the 0 Volts and Amps output measurements).
In this case ORP was turned on and the &quot;ORP set&quot; value was
adjusted to 6 Ohms (settings of 0.01 Ohms up to 10 Ohms are
permitted) and the ORP delay was left at &quot;Auto&quot; (these
settings are found in the SHIFT then [^] menu). The RD6018 was
connected to an electronic load which was placed in CR (constant
resistance) mode at 5 Ohms. ORP was triggered because the PS measured
its output voltage divided by its output current (i.e. the effective
load resistance) was 5 Ohms which is less than 6 Ohms from &quot;ORP
set&quot;. It took about a second to trip after the ON/OFF button
enabled the output (the electronic load was already on). So it is not
quick enough to limit inrush current, more likely it is looking at
the average of several V/I calculations for that second.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">To demonstrate the
ORP delay setting, it was set to its maximum value of 10 seconds
while the ORP setting was 1.12 Ohms and the Graph Window was set to 1
minute (its minimum). The attached electronic load was set to 1 Ohm
and turned on before the RD6018 (plus the graphing was started about
15 seconds before that). What can be seen below is that the PS output
9 Volts and 9 Amps (it was in CV mode) for approximately 10 seconds
and then tripped out with ORP. So the ORP delay setting waits that
amount of time <i>before</i> calculating V/I to determine whether ORP
should trip, and it does because the effective load resistance is 1
Ohm which is less than the ORP set value (1.12 Ohms). There was no
beep when OCR was triggered, perhaps that should be a default
setting.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">View mode could then
be selected (MEM then ENTER) so the reference vertical red line
cursor could be moved left and right to get the timestamps of the
turn ON to ORP trip and thus calculate the hold-off delay. The ORP
trip indication (white letters, red background) was cleared when view
mode was selected, perhaps it should be kept.</p>
