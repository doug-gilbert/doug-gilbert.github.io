        Partial Electrification for North American railways   20211008
        ---------------------------------------------------


Introduction
============
This article makes a case for retrofitting partial electrification (PE) via
overhead wiring to existing North American freight railways. It would require
battery powered electric locomotives (bELs) added to the existing stock of
locomotives. A mainline bEL would typically have a 3.5 MWh battery made up
of LFP cells. Initially only the oldest, least efficient diesel electric
locomotives (DELs) on branch lines would be retired.

The North American freight rail system can be subdivided into two groups:
"Class 1" railways and "short lines". After 40 years of consolidation over
100 Class 1 railways have been reduced to only 6 or 7, each spanning around
half or more of the North American continent. With a few exceptions most of
the remaining independently operated railways own relatively short railways,
typically interconnecting at one end of their branch line to a Class 1
railway.

This article proposes adding overhead electrification to around a quarter of
the Class 1 railway main lines with a greater proportion electrified in
steeply graded sections and at a lesser proportion in very flat areas (e.g.
the Prairies in Canada). For the short lines, little traditional overhead
electrification may be needed, perhaps mainly in steeply graded sections.
Instead short line locomotives could be equipped with similar ground level
charge ports as used by long distance electric trucks. Where a short line
joins its "parent" Class 1 railway, there may already be overhead
electrification.  If not, an electrified siding could be provided where a
short line bEL could recharge (or a main line bEL could recharge in an
emergency).


Modern Electric Railway Infrastructure
======================================
Most recently electrified railway lines use a fixed 25 kVac, permanently
energized overhead contact wire at a height of approximately 6.5 metres above
the rail height. The line frequency of the alternating current (AC) in nearly
all cases would be the power grid's distribution frequency of the country in
question; typically either 50 Hertz, or 60 Hertz as in North America.

The overhead contact wire, plus the associated catenary wire needs a
clearance of at least 0.25 meters at 25 kVac and twice that at 50 kVac. This
can be a major problem when adding overhead electrification after a line has
been built. These problems arise where a railway has restricted vertical
clearance such as in a tunnel or under a road overpass. When Norwegian
authorities investigated the cost of retrofitting overhead electrification
on an existing 725 km line between Trondheim and BÃ¸do they found one of the
largest (unexpected) cost items was lowering the existing line in tunnels
and snow sheds (because this line crosses the Arctic circle) to allow for
the required overhead clearances. They chose PE over full electrification
and other options. See reference [1].


Modern Electric Locomotives
===========================
Like modern, high power diesel electric locomotives, modern electric
locomotives use AC traction motors that are either induction or synchronous
motors. Those motors are typically driven by a variable voltage, variable
frequency (VVVF) 3 phase supply. Modern power electronics allows the efficient
generation of that VVVF 3 phase supply, typically starting with a DC voltage
in the range of 2 to 5 kV. Note that modern electric rail infrastructure
supplies power at a fixed frequency a and fixed voltage with overhead
voltage typically being higher than the traction motors can efficiently use.
So the overhead voltage must be reduced.

Diesel electric locomotives have a single diesel engine that drives a 3 phase
AC alternator that is rectified to obtain the DC voltage in the required
range. Electric locomotives have a pantograph to pick up power from the
contact wire. Typically on the roof of an EL there are safety breakers to
protect it from over-voltage (e.g. lightning strikes) and other mishaps. The
high voltage at the pantograph is typically fed down to an isolation or
traction single phase transformer. The secondary side of that transformer is
rectified to obtain the DC voltage in the required range.

Modern DELs and ELs are quite similar: they both do AC->DC->AC conversions.
The initial AC is a bit different: 3 phase for the DEL, single phase for the
EL. From the point where the DC voltage is available, they are essentially
the same. That means, for example, that a pair of locomotives, one a new EL,
the other a modified DEL, could haul a heavy train up a grade with all the
power coming from the EL's overhead and its traction transformer, with the
shared 2 to 5 kV DC being fed to the DEL via cables between the locomotives.
Assuming mainline North American locomotives of 4400 horsepower (hp)
(approximately 3.3 MW), the diesel engine in the DEL could be idling while
6.6 MW of power would be available for traction, half being driven via the EL
bogies (aka 'trucks'), the other half being driven via the DEL bogies.

On bELs the battery pack could be an alternate source of the DC in the
AC->DC->AC conversions noted above. Supercapacitors could also be used as a
short term store, for example when the pantograph is lowered or locked
temporarily when the locomotive passes through a "dead" section.  Such "dead"
sections would be "at grade" road crossings and pedestrian over-bridges that
children use. Platforms at busy commuter stations rail might also be unwired.

Battery electric locomotives, without any provision to accept power from
overhead wiring, have already begun to appear on North American railways.
See reference [2].


Multiple overhead voltages
==========================
Rather than a fixed overhead voltage being "permanently" supplied to the
overhead contact wire by a traction substation, a range of voltages
could be provided.

These voltages could grouped as follows:
  - 0 Volts: don't waste energy when there is nothing "under the wires"
  - 85 Vac, line frequency: testing for shorts, indicates about to
    change to high voltage. Also could be used to flag a potential change
    from one high voltage level to another
  - high voltage: 15-35 kVac, line frequency: for traction power and
    battery recharging

The roof mounted high voltage equipment on a bEL could detect the group
and in the high voltage case, what that high voltage is. If that voltage
is acceptable it is fed to the traction or isolation transformer. That
transformer is an expensive item and could be made somewhat more expensive
by having multiple taps on the primary. This will allow the transformer
to provide a small voltage range on the transformer secondary, irrespective
of the primary voltage (i.e. 15 to 35 kV). Alternatively the decision could
be made that short line bELs could not operate at such a high traction
voltage and the roof mounted equipment would disallow a connection of say
35 kVac overhead to its traction transformer. Another approach is that a
main line traction substation that would normally supply >= 25 kVac could
reduce its output to 15 kVac if a short line bEL was detected "under its
wires".

The lower traction voltage of 15 kVac would target short line or shunting
operations. Overhead wire traction systems typically have a limit on the
amount of current that can be drawn when the locomotive is stationary,
typically in the range from 100 to 150 Amps. Above this value there is a
risk of welding the pantograph to the contact wire. When a locomotive is
moving it can typically "pull" as much as ten times its stationary current
limit. For the sake of argument we will take the stationary pantograph
current limit of 100 Amps which gives a maximum power of 1.5 MW when
stationary. So that is "1C" charging rate for a short line bEL. It is
assumed that little of the short lines will have any overhead line
electrification meaning that charging will typically take place when the
bEL is stationary; hence the importance of the stationary current limit.

Another reason to allow a range of voltages, especially for short lines,
is to allow local electricity utilities to potentially supply 1 phase
directly from its "medium" voltage distribution network. Many urban
distribution networks now use 27,600 Volts (e.g. here in Toronto). That
is a phase-to-phase voltage and the corresponding phase-to-ground voltage
is 16 kV which is within the proposed bEL high voltage range. The utility
company could place a pole-mounted, remotely controlled phase selector and
then feed the chosen phase to short line bEL on a nearby siding. The
network
utility could control which phase was chosen and how much power could be
drawn by the bEL. Some rural utilities use a distribution of 35 kV
(phase-to-phase) which is a little over 20 kV (phase-to-ground). That
would also be suitable to feed directly to a short line bEL .

The choice of an upper high voltage limit at 35 kV, 10 kV over the world
"standard" for railway overhead of 25 kV, is proposed for various reasons:
  - North American freight trains tend to be both heavier and longer than
    their European counterparts
  - there is the added load of recharging batteries during heavy traction
    load, for example on a grade. The recharging load is estimated to be
    up to 3.5 MW per bEL
  - the losses (in heat) in the overhead wiring are related to the square
    of the current passing through that wiring. Since the delivered power
    is the product of the voltage and the current, energy loss in the
    overhead is reduced when the highest practical overhead voltage is
    chosen. See formula (4) and its explanation below.


Contact wire height
===================
The highest "plate" height (found by the author) is 6.5 metres. That may well
be for double stacked containers and "autostack" wagons that carry passenger
cars at 3 levels. Allowing a 0.35 metre clearance for 35 kV (the highest
traction voltage) takes the contact wire height (above the rails) to close to
7 metres. A document found online propose a height of 7.4 metres for 25 kV
overhead and 8 metres for 50 kV overhead. That would suggest that 7.6 metres
may be appropriate for 35 kV overhead.

There is obviously an extra cost to such high catenary: longer poles and
larger foundations for each pole.

Many short lines (perhaps the majority) were never built for wagons that are
6.5 metres high and would require significant work to allow that and there
is no economic basis for doing so. Such short lines (and Class 1 main lines
that have the same height restrictions), should be allowed to install PE, as
required, at a lower contact wire height. This could be around 6.5 metres
nominal over rail height. As discussed in the next section, any section that
is height constrained (e.g. a tunnel) should not be wired. A feature of PE
is that it shouldn't further constrain any vertical clearances.


Placement of overhead wiring
============================
The placement of the overhead wiring would be an interesting Operations
Research problem. For the sake of argument let us assume two types of
bELs:
  - main line: 3.5 MWh batteries, if discharged at "1C' that would be
    3.5 MW for one hour. 3.5 MW is a little higher than the power main
    line DELs use today: 4400 hp or 3.3 MW. Assume the batteries can
    charge and discharge at "1C". Same weight as 4400 hp DELs: just
    under 200 tonnes
  - short line: 1.5 MWh batteries for about 2500 hp. Around 120 tonnes
    perhaps allow a battery "tender" for extended range if the short
    line passes through isolated areas

To allow greater flexibility substations and their associated overhead
should be allowed to be "dead", but not two adjacent substations. This
implies that each bEL, starting with fully charged batteries should be
able to pass through an unwired section, then a wired section where the
overhead is "dead" and then through another unwired section. We assume it
batteries are now depleted and need recharging. The next paragraph puts
some numbers to this scenario.

Assume the average power used for traction over a relatively flat section
of track is 33% of rated power. The main line bEL should be able to run for
three hours. It is assumed a bEL can recharge its batteries in any downhill
section once it has reached its desired speed. Further assume that a
traction substation has 15 km of wired track either side of it. So if the
PE is covering a quarter of the track, the next wired section will be 90 km
away. Further assume that substation is out-of-service (and 30 km long) then
the train must continue for another 120 km before it enters an electrified
wired section. So in this case the bEL needs to travel 90+120=210 km under
its own power. If it can maintain an average speed of 70 km/h then it will
just make it. The train may well make it if it runs slower as it requires
less kinetic energy (m*v^2)/2 and wind resistance will be a little less,
but it will take longer than three hours.

When all substations are operational with the above example, then a "1C"
charge rate should be sufficient to replenish the battery to the level
that it started the journey, so the train can continue indefinitely. In the
one substation out-of-service case the train would either need to charge
at the next working substation at a rate higher than "1C" or slow down in
that wired section to take on more energy.

Obviously steeply grade sections (e.g. approaching a mountain range) will
require a greater proportion of the track to be wired. Since the traction
transformer in a bEL needs to be rated to handle both the rated traction
load and "1C" recharging of its batteries, then if the batteries are already
full (or close to full and thus need less power) then more power could be
made available for traction. Hence it might be useful to size a main line
bEL's traction motors to provide more than 3.3 MW (4400 hp), perhaps 1 MW
more. This would allow a bEL to run up a steeply graded section more
quickly than the equivalent DEL, but only while "under the wires" and after
the battery no longer needed "1C" charge power (a maximum of 3.5 MW).

On single track main lines there must be passing loops (i.e. two track
sections). Since trains must wait in these loops for opposing movements to
pass, each wired section should include at least one passing loop.

Some railway sections should not be wired. Apart from "at grade" crossings
complex rail junctions (e.g. leading to a major station) and intermodal
yards should be wire free. Anywhere where vertical clearance is an issue
(e.g. tunnels) or safety may be a concern can be left unwired. Automatic
systems could be installed trackside to instruct a passing bEL to lower
its pantograph and later raise it again.

Wired sections need additional work done to them such as bonding the
rails to make sure they are an effective ground path for the high voltage
present in the overhead. Also rail electrification tends to interfere with
existing signalling equipment. Rather than replace existing signalling in
wired sections, in-cabin signalling should be investigated as that seems
to be the direction that all new railway signalling is heading.

Transition period
=================
Electrifying main lines that are in operation is a relatively slow process.
Even electrifying a quarter of North American main lines still implies
electrifying thousands of kilometres of track. While this could be started
relatively quickly, concentrating on electrifying short lines may be a
better approach.

The Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) methodology has improved the market
value of the class 1 railways in North America, but delivered worse service
to transport users; or "less for more" as one shipper put it. Under PSR the
class 1 railways run less trains, but they are heavier and longer. Also short
lines are required to do more switching and building up blocks of wagons at
their class 1 railway interconnect. For transport users, service levels have
declined, for example, where previously there was a 5 day service (i.e. 1
train per business day) under PSR there may only be a 3 day service (e.g.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday). So a traffic accident in Chicago may delay an
interchange between two class 1 freights, so that a customer expecting a
container on Wednesday, receives it on Friday instead. The short line
operator delivering the container to the customer has no way of appeasing
the disgruntled customer who may well switch to road freight in the future.

Even before PSR took hold, the class_1/short_line model did not compete when
the distance to traverse was less than 600 to 1000 miles (i.e. up to 1,600
km) because the class 1 railway involved saw an insufficient profit margin.
Block trains (e.g. a train where all wagons are coal or wheat moving to the
same destination) are about the only exception, leaving a huge segment of the
transport effort to other modes (i.e. mainly trucks on highways). An upside
of PSR is that class 1 main lines have more track capacity, capacity that
their short line partners might use, as suggested below.

Short lines tend to have the industry's oldest, dirtiest and least efficient
locomotives which are often "hand-me-downs" from the class I railways.
Creative financing and even grants of bELs to short line by governments and
corporates could result in many benefits. As a large proportion of freight
moves involve a short line at one end of the move, these new short line bELs
could be brightly coloured and could carry logos of sponsors together with
the short line's livery. This would both be a travelling billboard and help
with visibility for safety as the bEL would be quieter than the DEL it
replaced. The absence of petroleum products would also mean the bright new
livery would remain fresh for longer. Each bEL could be equipped with a
colourful drone to hover over each at grade road crossing about to be
crossed by the bEL's train. Video from the drone could be fed back to the
bEL driver showing if a vehicle was blocking the line.

In return for the benefit of one or more new bELs and cheaper "fuel" (i.e.
electricity), each short line could lower its rates, say by 5%, for say 5
years, under a contract with the government.

Short lines face an asymmetric power relationship with the class 1 railway
that they interchange with (assuming there is only one). The government
could allow short lines with single class 1 interconnect, trackage rights
on the mainline, proportional to the size (e.g. route miles) of the short
line, up to some limit, say 100 miles (160 km), either side of the
interconnection point. The fees and conditions for those trackage rights
could be determined by an independent third party, perhaps a class 1 railway
from another part of North America. The benefit to the original short line
operator, and its customers, is more competition.

These trackage rights for short lines allow several short lines to chain
across their parent's main line, allowing for moves of a few hundred miles
that the associated short lines see as profitable but their parent class
1 main line does not.


DC Electrical Energy and Power
==============================
The energy and power equations governing direct current (DC) are relatively
straightforward. In the formulae below '*' is used for multiplication and '^'
is used to denote raising the value on the left to the power on the right.
We start with a general physics equation linking energy and power:
    E = P * t      (1)

In SI units, 'E' is energy in joules, 'P' is power in Watts and 't' is time
in seconds. The electrical power industry tends to use larger units for
energy: kilowatt-hours (kWh), megawatt-hours (MWh), terawatt-hours (TWh),
etc. Common units for power are: kilowatt (kW), megawatt (MW), terawatt (TW),
etc. A kilowatt-hour is three million, six hundred thousand (1000x60x60)
joules.  Electrical power in a load is the product volts (V) across that
load and current (I in amps) through the load:
    P = V * I      (2)

Then Ohm's law establishes are relationship between voltage and current
through a load or conductor:
    V = I * R      (3)
where 'R' is the resistance of a load expressed in Ohms. All conductors
have non-zero resistance apart from superconductors which are not relevant
here. Combining formulae (2) and (3) by substituting 'V' gives:
    P = I^2 * R    (4)

The last formula, amongst other things, gives the power loss across the
catenary which is greatest at the "far end" of the catenary from the
traction substation. Catenary resistance is proportional to distance, and
if, for example, it approaches 1 Ohm and if a heavy train with multiple
(b)ELs pulls 1000 Amps that will be 1 Megawatt (of heat in the catenary)
which is a significant loss. This formula indicates that for a required
power at a load (e.g. a bEL) it is best to maximize the voltage subject to
other constraints.


AC Electrical Energy and Power
==============================
For alternating current (AC) systems the above formulae still hold but, and
it's a big but, for instantaneous voltage and current. In AC systems, the
source is providing/enforcing the voltage which is typically a sine wave
with a period of 20 millisecond (50 Hertz) or 16.666 milliseconds (60 Hertz).
The load (e.g. a bEL) dictates the current that is drawn, and it is also
ideally a sine wave. In practice representing the source AC voltage as a
sine wave is a good approximation, however the current waveform can be
described as a "mess". And as the power electronics in (b)ELs gets more
efficient (and sophisticated) the current waveform can get even messier.

Multiplying time varying voltage and current together in formula (2) is not
very enlightening. At least both waveforms tend to have the same period so
we tend to look at the average power across a period and assume it will be
essentially the same from one period to the next. For this purpose we look
at the "root mean squared" (rms) values of AC voltage and current. All AC
voltages and currents used in this article are rms values (e.g. 25 kVac).
The average power formula for AC plus an important variant for accountants
and electric utilities follow:
    P = Vrms * Irms * pf    (2.1)
    VA = Vrms * Irms        (2.2)

The average power formula (2.1) has a new term: the power factor (pf) which
is a value between 0 and 1. A power factor near 1 is considered "good" and
we never want to see a power factor of 0. The "voltamp" (VA) formula (2.2)
is simply the product of Vrms and Irms and while the units of both sides
are Watts, the left hand side is called VA to indicate something is
different. That something is the power factor. Industrial users (including
power utilities themselves) typically get billed in multiples of VA by their
upstream provider. This means wherever the upstream power provider places
their VA meters for billing purposes, the user wants their power factor to
be a close to 1 as practical. And cost is not the only reason to want a
power factor near 1: the Irms (i.e. the amperage) can be high enough to
damage equipment (and blow fuses) even though the average power is very
small because of a power factor approaching 0.

The ability to use a single phase from a power utility's 27.6 kV or 35 kV
medium voltage lines to recharge short line bELs could save a lot of money
that would otherwise be needed to build small traction substations. Two
important factors would be that:
  - the phase chosen (of the 3 available) would not imbalance the 3 phase
    circuit too much
  - the power factor is acceptable (i.e. close to 1)

The first factor would be a matter of the power utility picking its least
loaded phase and putting an upper limit on the amperage that the bEL could
draw. This second factor could be addressed by the bEL being built with
some "power factor correction" (pfc) equipment.


Three phase AC and overhead voltage
===================================
Three phase power is the most common way large scale AC is generated and
distributed long distances. Each phase has the same rms voltage (as high
as 735 kV in Quebec) and the same frequency but differs in phase by 120
degrees (or one third of a revolution) from the other two wires (i.e.
phases). It is not practical to deliver three phase power to a EL (although
it has been tried) so a single phase is used instead. Power utilities like
to have a similar load on all phases so rail traction supply systems can
cause issues.

Older rail electrification systems used 1.5 and 3 kV DC overhead because
traction motors of that time were DC machines. Power electronics
developments over the last 40 years have made AC machines the modern
traction motors of choice. The power electronics has also made switching
between AC and DC (and vice versa) a lot easier and more efficient.

So why does modern rail electrification use AC in the overhead wiring,
rather than DC? Here are a few reasons:
  - less arcing with AC. Since AC is alternating around 0 Volts, arcs tend
    to be broken at the time of zero crossing. So for the same power a DC
    circuit breaker tends to be much larger than a AC breaker. Plus the
    arcing between the contact wire and the pantograph is less with AC.
  - galvanic issues (e.g. rust). This is still an issue with AC but to a
    lesser degree than with DC
  - the upstream power provider (a power utility normally) typically has
    power available in three phase AC which a transformer can alter
    as required for the overhead. DC overhead needs an extra step to
    convert AC to DC: rectification


Battery charge and discharge rates
==================================
All batteries generate (discharge) or receive (charge) DC. They have a
nominal voltage and an energy storage figure, given in watt-hours or
kilowatt-hours. An informal "<n>C" maximum (dis-)charge rate figure has
emerged in the industry, where <n> is a small integer. For example: a 1000
Volt, 1 megawatt-hour battery rated at "1C" for discharge and charge, can
generate (discharge) a maximum of 1 megawatt for 1 hour if it was full at
the start of the hour. Similarly the same battery when empty can accept
a total of 1 MW for 1 hour to charge it to full.

The "<n>C" figure is an engineering "rule of thumb" as for a bEL the train
weight and track profile will dictate how much power is required. On the
battery charge side, the battery chemistry and its current "state of
charge" will dictate how much power should be provided. The "<n>C" figure
puts a loose upper limit on these figures. Often a battery has different
"<n>C" figure on charge and discharge cycles. In the short term these
charge/discharge rates can be exceeded; on the discharge side this often
leads to a build up of heat in the battery and its associated electronics.
On the charge side, exceeding the recommended charge rate can lessen the
number of charge/discharge cycles in the battery's lifetime.

In this article's rough calculations above, a charge/discharge figure of
"1C" has been assumed.

Batteries are made up of cells, where each cell's nominal voltage is fixed
by the cell chemistry (e.g. 3.2 Volts for LFP cells). Battery DC voltage is
increased by putting cells in series. Battery DC amperage (current) is
increased by putting cells in parallel.


Conclusion
==========
Partial electrification may be a case of where "less is more". So called
"full electrification" will still need diesel locomotives for rarely used
sidings and yards with overhead gantry cranes (e.g. near sea ports). Also
in emergency situations like a catenary break or a traction substation
fire or upgrade, DELs would be needed. Even If DELs were outlawed then
something like the battery electric locomotive would be needed.

With the PE being proposed, only around a quarter of the main lines would
need to be electrified and little of the branch lines serviced mainly by
the short line railways. By avoiding electrifying areas with low vertical
clearances (e.g. tunnels) many costs and outages (e.g. while the rail line
is lowered) could be avoided. Perhaps half as many traction substations
would be needed, but each would need to supply about twice as much power
(and energy) as substations needed for full electrification. Short line
bELs could also share ground level charging infrastructure with electric
long haul trucks. Half or more of the equipment in modern AC DELs could
be re-utilized, by either replacing the diesel engine with batteries or
running DC power cables from a coupled bEL.

Full electrification systems tend to have the same overhead voltage (and
frequency if AC) throughout the system. The PE system proposed would allow
a range of AC voltages (and two catenary heights above the rails) to
better suit local conditions.
